Your task is to research and create ONE final, publication-ready, platform-neutral market-intelligence article using only the inputs supplied below.

You are NOT given a reference article.

You must independently determine:

the strongest editorial thesis

the most appropriate article structure

the best H2/H3 hierarchy

the right balance of paragraphs, bullets and callouts

the most useful internal links

the most authoritative external sources

the most decision-relevant market insights

writing example

This prompt is self-contained.

Report Title:
${reportTitle}

Market Name:
${reportTitle}

Primary Report URL:
${reportUrl}

Optional Primary Keyword:


Optional Secondary Keywords:


Create a premium, research-led article that:

Provides genuine market intelligence.

Is useful to business decision-makers.

Is suitable for Google organic search.

Is structured clearly for AI search, AI Overviews, retrieval and citation.

Demonstrates real information gain.

Uses Ken Research proprietary data accurately.

Clearly separates proprietary estimates from official statistics.

Uses credible external evidence.

Uses natural, well-spaced internal linking.

Avoids keyword stuffing.

Avoids excessive promotion.

Avoids generic AI wording.

Avoids one-line paragraph fragmentation.

Avoids paragraph-only walls of text.

Uses useful H2s, H3s, bullets and limited callouts.

Includes a meaningful counter-thesis/risk view.

Can be published directly as clean HTML.

Does NOT require a reference article.

The final article should feel like:

MARKET RESEARCH
+
BUSINESS ANALYSIS
+
EDITORIAL INSIGHT
+
SEO QUALITY
+
AI-SEARCH READABILITY
+
SOURCE TRANSPARENCY

It must NOT feel like:

KEYWORD PAGE
+
GENERIC TEMPLATE
+
SALES LANDING PAGE
+
AI FILLER

Start with the supplied Primary Report URL.

Research the Ken Research website and determine whether a newer/current version of the same market or data framework exists.

Extract only supported information such as:

publication date

study period

historical period

base year

forecast period

market value

forecast value

CAGR

historical growth

physical volume

transaction count

subscribed units

project count

installed base

ASP / ARPU / value per unit

dominant segment

fastest-growing segment

dominant geography

fastest-growing geography

deployment/channel/business model

customer type

growth mechanisms

operating economics

risks

competitive participants

regulatory considerations

methodology

respondent/sample count

market-sizing basis

supporting metrics

Never invent a number because a field is missing.

If several Ken Research pages contain different figures for the same market:

Compare publication dates.

Identify the newest complete dataset.

Prefer the newest reliable framework.

Use ONE internally consistent dataset.

Do NOT mix old and new values.

Use the newest relevant report URL when appropriate.

Do not confuse readers with obsolete values unless the comparison itself is analytically important.

Treat Ken Research market figures as proprietary estimates unless explicitly identified otherwise.

Never present proprietary estimates as government statistics.

Research approximately 2–4 authoritative external sources.

The final article normally needs only 2–3 external links.

Priority:

Government ministry

National statistics office

Regulator

Central bank

Customs/trade authority

Transport/port authority

Official industry body

Primary company disclosure

Highly credible institutional source

External evidence may validate:

regulation

trade

infrastructure

demographics

payments

transport activity

internet usage

policy

technology adoption

government programs

customs

company infrastructure investments

Do not add external links merely to increase source count.

Every sourced statistic must retain the correct:

year

unit

geography

population/sample where relevant

context

Before writing, determine:

"What is actually changing in this market, and why does it matter commercially?"

Do NOT default to:
"The market is growing because demand is increasing."

Look for the strongest mechanism.

Examples:

basic service shifting toward advanced analytics

recurring revenue replacing transaction revenue

value growth exceeding volume growth

digital channel changing distribution economics

cloud changing cost structures

regulation creating demand

premiumization offsetting demographic weakness

outsourcing raising service intensity

automation improving productivity

infrastructure constraining demand

affordability weakening real growth

fragmented competition favoring integrated players

local sourcing reducing import risk

e-commerce increasing logistics intensity

data governance becoming a buying criterion

The article must be built around the strongest supported thesis.

Before writing, silently create THREE possible editorial structures.

Do NOT output them.

The three structures must differ in:

central thesis

opening angle

H2 sequence

H2 wording

H3 usage

section grouping

position of competition

position of regulation

position of geography

position of segment analysis

treatment of risk

bullet usage

callout placement

Evaluate the 3 structures based on:

Which best explains the actual economics?

Which surfaces proprietary information most effectively?

Which provides the most information gain?

Which is most useful to decision-makers?

Which avoids generic market-report templating?

Which creates the strongest SEO/AIO structure?

Select ONE.

Output ONE final article only.

Do NOT generate every article with the same flow.

Do NOT mechanically use:

Market Size
→ Drivers
→ Segments
→ Competition
→ Regulation
→ Outlook

Different industries should naturally produce different architectures.

For example:

TECH / SaaS / CYBERSECURITY may emphasize:

recurring revenue

cloud

adoption

talent

automation

integration

compliance

LOGISTICS may emphasize:

trade flows

corridor economics

utilization

freight

warehousing

outsourcing

infrastructure

FMCG / RETAIL may emphasize:

consumer demand

basket economics

pricing

distribution

channel mix

affordability

sourcing

HEALTHCARE may emphasize:

disease burden

access

reimbursement

regulation

capacity

adoption

pricing

LUXURY / FASHION may emphasize:

affluent demand

tourism

price mix

product categories

digital channels

import exposure

AGRICULTURE may emphasize:

yield

farm economics

input costs

technology

water

infrastructure

climate

regulation

CONSTRUCTION may emphasize:

project pipeline

capex

permits

materials

labor

financing

infrastructure

The exact headings must be written for the specific industry.

QUALITY RULES remain fixed even when structure changes.

Avoid generic/repetitive H2s such as:

Growth Drivers
Key Trends
Market Opportunities
Competitive Landscape
Market Analysis

Prefer analytical headings.

Examples:

Instead of:
"Growth Drivers"

Use:
"Fuel Economics Are Making Analytics Easier to Justify"

Instead of:
"Competitive Landscape"

Use:
"Competition Is Moving From Devices to Analytics Capability"

Instead of:
"Key Trends"

Use:
"Cloud Delivery Is Lowering the Barrier to Adoption"

Headings should communicate an insight.

Do not repeatedly reuse the same H2 wording across different reports.

Generate before the article:

SEO Title

SEO TITLE ROLE:
The SEO Title is the search-facing title. Its job is to preserve strong market/entity relevance while adding a distinctive, report-specific commercial angle.

MANDATORY SEO TITLE RULES:

- Retain the recognizable core Market Name / primary market entity in the SEO Title.
- Do NOT rewrite the market name so aggressively that the main search entity becomes unclear.
- Keep the market/entity phrase prominent, preferably at or near the beginning.
- Make the second half dynamic and based on the strongest VERIFIED commercial thesis in the report.
- The SEO Title must be unique, punchy, search-intent aligned, and useful rather than generic.
- The SEO Title must be meaningfully different from the H1.
- Do NOT include "Ken Research" in the SEO Title by default.
- Do NOT mechanically use generic formulas such as:
  "[Market Name] Size, Share, Trends & Forecast"
  unless that wording is genuinely required by the search intent.
- Do NOT force a rigid character limit if doing so damages the market entity or meaning.
- Keep the title as concise as the market name allows; prioritize entity clarity, search relevance and click appeal over arbitrary character-count compliance.
- Do NOT invent an angle merely to make the title sound dramatic.
- Every thesis used in the SEO Title must be supported by the researched market evidence.

DYNAMIC SEO TITLE FAMILIES:

Choose or create the pattern that best fits the report. Examples include:

- [Market Name] Enters a Higher-Value Growth Phase
- [Market Name] Shifts From [Old Model] to [New Model]
- [Market Name] Moves Toward [Important Commercial Shift]
- [Market Name]: Growth Beyond [Old Growth Mechanism]
- [Market Name] Builds a Stronger [Revenue / Channel / Technology] Story
- [Market Name] Expands Beyond [Traditional Category / Channel]
- [Market Name]: [Emerging Segment] Reshapes Growth
- [Market Name] Moves Into a [New Economics]-Led Phase
- [Market Name] Targets [Commercial Outcome] Through [Forecast Year]
- [Market Name]: [Key Metric / Behavior] Becomes the New Driver

These are style families, NOT fixed templates.
Do NOT mechanically reuse them.
Create a new phrasing when the market evidence suggests a better angle.

Example:

Market Name:
Poland Online Food Delivery Aggregator Market

Strong SEO Title:
Poland Online Food Delivery Aggregator Market Shifts From Reach to Revenue

Another valid style:
Poland Online Food Delivery Aggregator Market: Growth Beyond User Acquisition

Meta Description

approximately 140–160 characters

useful

non-promotional

include core figure(s) when valuable

Plain text only — no HTML tags, no <strong>, no Markdown bold/links, no formatting of any kind. Numbers and figures appear as plain digits (e.g. "USD 63 million", not "<strong>USD 63 million</strong>").

Also generate:

Primary Search Intent

Primary Keyword

5–8 Secondary Semantic Topics

Suggested Snapshot Image Alt

Use exactly ONE H1.

H1 ROLE:
The H1 is the editorial headline. It should be more expressive, insight-led and attention-grabbing than the SEO Title while still making the market/topic immediately understandable.

MANDATORY H1 RULES:

- The H1 must be meaningfully different from the SEO Title.
- The H1 must preserve a recognizable market/topic reference, but it does NOT need to repeat the complete formal Market Name word-for-word if a shorter natural expression is clearer.
- The H1 must include <strong>Ken Research</strong> naturally.
- The H1 should communicate the strongest VERIFIED market tension, milestone, opportunity, risk, transformation or strategic question.
- A verified market value / forecast / milestone may be used when it materially strengthens the headline.
- If a visible number appears in the HTML H1, apply the existing mandatory number-bolding rule.
- Do NOT invent a risk, barrier, opportunity or numerical milestone for headline impact.
- The headline may be longer than the SEO Title when editorial clarity requires it.
- Avoid robotic keyword repetition.
- Avoid repeating the same H1 grammar across different reports.
- Do NOT automatically use "Tracks", "Flags", "Hits", "Nears", or any other single verb in every article.
- Vary the editorial construction according to the report and industry.

ALLOWED H1 APPROACHES:

1. QUESTION / STRATEGIC-TENSION STYLE

Use when the report supports a genuine strategic question.

Example:

<h1>Can Poland's Food Delivery Platforms Turn Reach Into Revenue Quality? <strong>Ken Research</strong> Tracks the <strong>USD 2.03B</strong> Opportunity</h1>

2. MILESTONE + BARRIER / RISK STYLE

Use when a forecast milestone and a meaningful constraint are both strongly supported.

Example:

<h1>Thailand Agri-Equipment Rental Market Hits <strong>USD 1B</strong>: <strong>Ken Research</strong> Flags Service Reliability as the Bigger Loyalty Barrier</h1>

3. TRANSFORMATION STYLE

Example logic:

[Market / Industry] Moves From [Old Model] Toward [New Model]: <strong>Ken Research</strong> Examines What Changes the Economics

4. OPPORTUNITY + EXECUTION STYLE

Example logic:

[Market / Industry] Opens a New [Opportunity] Layer: <strong>Ken Research</strong> Highlights the Execution Test

5. COMMERCIAL-TENSION STYLE

Example logic:

[Market / Industry] Growth Accelerates, but [Constraint] Changes the Economics: <strong>Ken Research</strong> Maps the Trade-Off

IMPORTANT:

- Question-style H1s are allowed but NOT mandatory.
- Use a question only when it creates a genuine decision-oriented tension.
- Do NOT make every H1 a question.
- Do NOT use the same H1 family repeatedly across consecutive reports.
- The H1 must feel written for the specific market, not filled into a headline template.
- SEO Title = search-led and market-entity-led.
- H1 = editorial, branded, insight-led.
- They must complement each other rather than repeat each other.

Use 2–3 proper introductory paragraphs.

Normal paragraph:

2–4 sentences

usually 45–110 words

one coherent analytical idea

Paragraph 1 should establish:

market identity

market change

base value

forecast value

CAGR

Paragraph 2 should explain:

why the market is changing

why that mechanism matters commercially

Paragraph 3 (required — this is the second interlinking placement, paragraph 1's Ken Research homepage link being the first):

major risk

counter-thesis

operating tension

Include exactly one contextual link to a genuinely relevant adjacent Ken Research report here (same verification and UTM rules as every other adjacent-report link — see LINK ARCHITECTURE below). This becomes "Adjacent #1" — do not also place a separate first-adjacent link in the early H2 section; the early/early-middle H2 instead carries "Adjacent #2", the middle H2 carries "Adjacent #3", and so on, each one slot further down the sequence than before.

Do NOT link the Ken Research homepage a second time here — paragraph 1 already used that single mandatory homepage placement. This paragraph's link is a different, topic-relevant adjacent report, not a repeat of the homepage.

Within roughly the first 150 words the reader should understand:

what the market is

current/base value

forecast direction

why it is changing

Within the first 200–250 words, naturally include one concise market-scope sentence where useful.

Explain what the market includes and, where relevant, excludes.

Use only the primary report's supported scope.

Do not invent categories.

Do not write it like a dictionary definition.

The first natural occurrence of Ken Research must link exactly once to:

https://www.kenresearch.com/

Required format:

<a href="https://www.kenresearch.com/">
  <strong>Ken Research</strong>
</a>

Purpose:

brand attribution

publisher identity

research provenance

Rules:

homepage link exactly once

do not repeat homepage later

do not add "Visit Ken Research"

do not use homepage as CTA

later Ken Research mentions remain bold but unlinked

The Primary Report URL must normally be linked ONLY ONCE in the FINAL ARTICLE,
inside the final commercial CTA.

Do NOT link the Primary Report URL in the introduction.

The first important market-name mention in the introduction should remain
plain text or may be bold if editorially useful, but it must NOT carry
the Primary Report URL.

Purpose:

prevent duplicate primary-report linking

reduce promotional density

avoid two Ken Research-domain links appearing together in the introduction

preserve the final CTA as the primary conversion point

Normal architecture:

INTRODUCTION:

Ken Research homepage branding link only

BODY:

contextual adjacent-market links

FINAL CTA:

Primary Report link

Do not repeat the primary-report URL elsewhere in the article unless an
exception is explicitly required by the user.

EVERY visible occurrence of:

Ken Research

must be:

<strong>Ken Research</strong>

If linked:

<a href="https://www.kenresearch.com/">
  <strong>Ken Research</strong>
</a>

Never leave visible Ken Research unbolded.

Every meaningful visible number must be bold.

Examples:

<strong>USD 63 million</strong>

<strong>2025</strong>

<strong>13.6%</strong>

<strong>160,000 vehicles</strong>

<strong>58%</strong>

<strong>216 respondents</strong>

<strong>5–7 years</strong>

<strong>2025–2032</strong>

Applies to:

market values

years

ranges

percentages

currency

volumes

counts

units

shares

ASP

ARPU

transaction counts

subscriber counts

respondent counts

external statistics

Do NOT bold numbers inside:

URLs

HTML attributes

image dimensions

tracking parameters

code

After the introduction include ONE snapshot-image placeholder, and include a SECOND image placeholder further down the article — in the middle or lower section, after the drivers/competitive-landscape discussion and before the conclusion.

Do NOT create an HTML table.

Use exactly these tags — a bare img with only src and alt, nothing else (no <figure>, no <figcaption>, no width/height/loading attributes, no caption text of any kind):

<img src="YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE" alt="[DESCRIPTIVE ALT]">

<img src="YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE_2" alt="[DESCRIPTIVE ALT]">

Choose approximately 5–7 supported metrics for the base set below, PLUS any of the optional multi-value fields (Segment Breakdown, Key Players, Market Share) whenever the report actually publishes that data — these feed a downstream chart generator that renders each metric as a real chart (donut, gauge, bar comparison), so the EXACT field name and value format below must be followed. Never fabricate a metric or a value to fit a format — omit the field entirely if the report does not support it.

Base set — plain "Label: Value" line, one metric per line:

Base Market Value

Forecast Value

CAGR

Market Volume / Units

Leading Segment

Fastest-Growing Segment

Dominant Geography

Major Driver

Major Constraint

MANDATORY VALUE FORMATS (the chart generator parses these patterns literally):

Trend metric (renders as a bar-comparison chart) — value is two or three chronological points joined by " → ", each ending in "in {year}":
Completed Orders: 3.8 million in 2025 → 8.5 million in 2031
Revenue per User: USD 12 in 2025 → USD 15.5 in 2028 → USD 19 in 2031

Share metric (renders as a donut) — label must contain the word "Share" (not "Breakdown") and the value must end in a percentage:
Fresh-Food Share: 41.0% in 2025

Segment Breakdown (renders as a multi-slice donut) — label exactly "Segment Breakdown", value is a comma-separated "Name X%" list (3–5 segments, should sum close to 100%):
Segment Breakdown: Cloud Deployment 45%, On-Premise 30%, Hybrid 25%

Gauge metric (renders as a half-circle gauge) — label contains CAGR, Growth, Adoption, Penetration, Utilization, or Conversion, and the value is a percentage:
CAGR: 15.1%
Adoption Rate: 62% in 2025

Key Players (renders as a competitor name list) — label exactly "Key Players", value is a comma-separated list of company names:
Key Players: Acme Corp, Northwind Traders, Globex Inc

Market Share (renders as a ranked bar chart of competitors) — label exactly "Market Share", value is a comma-separated "Name X%" list, same companies as Key Players when both are used:
Market Share: Acme Corp 34%, Northwind Traders 22%, Globex Inc 15%

Only include Segment Breakdown, Key Players, and Market Share when the primary report (or a verified adjacent Ken Research report) actually publishes segment-level or competitor-level percentages — these are optional, not required for every article. Do not fabricate a metric.

SECOND IMAGE — separate from the metrics above, this feeds a second downstream chart (Forecast Growth + Competitive Landscape + Growth Drivers + Regional Heat Map — all rendered as bubbles/tiles, never a bar/line/pie/donut chart). Provide up to three lines, each optional — omit any line whose content the report doesn't actually support, never fabricate. List drivers in priority order (most important first) — order is used to indicate relative emphasis:

Growth Drivers: 3–4 short driver phrases, semicolon-separated, most important first:
Growth Drivers: Rising hybrid seed adoption; Government subsidy programs; Expansion of agro-dealer networks

Competitive Landscape: label exactly "Competitive Landscape", value is a comma-separated "Name X%" list of the same market's leading companies (reuse Key Players/Market Share figures if already verified above — do not re-derive different numbers):
Competitive Landscape: Acme Corp 27%, Northwind Traders 22%, Globex Inc 18%

Regional Landscape: label exactly "Regional Landscape", value is a comma-separated "Country/Region X%" list of the market's leading geographies by share (3–6 regions):
Regional Landscape: South Africa 34%, Kenya 21%, Nigeria 18%, Ethiopia 14%

The Forecast Growth panel itself is built from the Base Market Value / Forecast Value / CAGR already given above — do not repeat those here.

Typical article length:

1,500–2,200 words

Only when evidence supports that depth.

Do not pad the article merely to hit word count.

Use approximately 6–9 meaningful H2 sections.

A complex market may justify slightly more.

Do not create/delete sections purely to meet a numeric limit.

The article must NOT be one-liner-heavy.

The article must NOT be paragraph-only.

The article must NOT be a wall of text.

Normal analytical paragraphs:

2–4 sentences

roughly 45–110 words

one complete analytical idea

Avoid:

sentence-by-sentence <p> splitting

excessive single-sentence paragraphs

180–250 word blocks

dramatic AI-style fragmentation

Single-sentence paragraphs should normally remain below approximately 15–20% of body paragraphs.

Use them only for:

intentional emphasis

transition before bullets

callout

short conclusion

Every final article should contain a natural mix of:

analytical paragraphs

H2 sections

selective H3 sub-sections

useful bullet lists

limited blockquotes

Structural diversity does NOT mean turning the article into paragraph-only prose.

Likewise, formatting does NOT mean converting everything into lists.

Preferred editorial rhythm:

Paragraph
→ Paragraph
→ H3 or short setup
→ Bullets
→ Analytical interpretation

or:

Paragraph
→ Bullets
→ Paragraph

The exact amount must vary by market.

QUALITY must never decrease merely to create visual variation.

Use bullets when readers benefit from scanning.

Good uses:

operating questions

technology modules

demand drivers

risks

costs

competitive differentiators

buyer requirements

product/segment characteristics

signals to monitor

methodology components

Do not make every section a bullet list.

Do not make every section paragraphs.

Use lists only when useful.

Use H3 when a real subtopic deserves separation.

For a typical 1,500–2,200 word article:

approximately 2–5 useful H3 sub-sections may be appropriate

distribute them across different H2 sections where genuinely relevant

do NOT force every H2 to contain an H3

do NOT use H3 merely for decoration

do NOT create H3s followed by only one trivial sentence

Good H3 candidates include:

higher-value modules

use cases

buyer priorities

fastest-growing sub-segments

operating bottlenecks

channel economics

cost components

competitive differentiators

regional factors

methodology framework

Examples:

<h3>Higher-Value Analytics Modules</h3>

<h3>Potential Costs of Unplanned Downtime</h3>

<h3>Competitive Differentiation Is Moving Toward</h3>

If several related points are short:

H2
→ introductory paragraph
→ H3
→ bullets
→ analytical interpretation

may be appropriate.

Another H2 may use only analytical paragraphs when that reads better.

The goal is visual and analytical rhythm.

The final article must NOT become a continuous sequence of H2 + paragraph + paragraph with no visual variation.

Use maximum 2–3 blockquotes.

Use only for strategic conclusions.

Example:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>
      The market is moving from basic visibility toward operational intelligence.
    </strong>
  </p>
</blockquote>

These are editorial callouts.

Do not invent executive quotations.

Do not overuse.

Major sections should generally follow:

FACT
→ MECHANISM
→ BUSINESS IMPLICATION
→ COUNTER-RISK where relevant

Do not stop at facts.

Explain:

what changed

why it changed

who benefits

what it means commercially

what could weaken the trend

Avoid generic filler such as:

"Technology adoption is increasing."

Explain the economics behind the change.

Every strong quantitative or market-structure claim must be traceable to a
specific source.

This includes claims such as:

market share

platform concentration

"top X players account for Y%"

penetration rates

dominant segment percentages

fastest-growing segment claims

number of participants

transaction counts

active-user counts

adoption percentages

average commission rates

take rates

regulatory deadlines

historical CAGR

operating ratios

installed-base figures

Before using such a claim:

Confirm it appears in:

the primary Ken Research report

a verified adjacent Ken Research report

or an authoritative external source.

Preserve the exact:

year

unit

scope

geography

denominator where relevant.

Attribute the claim where attribution improves clarity.

If exact support cannot be verified:

REMOVE the number,
OR

rewrite the statement qualitatively.

Example:

If verified:
"The five core national platforms represented approximately
<strong>96%</strong> of aggregator GMV in <strong>2024</strong>."

If NOT verified:
"The market is concentrated among a small group of national platforms."

Never retain a precise number merely because it makes the article sound
authoritative.

Strong claims must survive source verification before publication.

Do not over-repeat the exact complete market name.

Use natural semantic variations.

Example:

Exact:
Nigeria Fleet Management Analytics Market

Alternatives:

Nigeria's fleet analytics market

fleet technology market

connected-fleet analytics

fleet-management software

telematics and analytics sector

the market

fleet technology ecosystem

Do not optimize to a fixed keyword-density percentage.

Do not repeat the exact market name in every heading.

Prioritize:

readability

entity clarity

topical depth

semantic coverage

Search the live Ken Research catalog.

Never guess an internal URL.

For each candidate:

Confirm the page exists.

Confirm URL resolves.

Confirm relevance.

Prefer country-specific reports where appropriate.

Prefer the most specific relevant market.

Avoid unrelated cross-country pages just to create links.

Identify the publication year/date of the adjacent report where available.

Prefer the newest relevant adjacent report when multiple versions exist.

Normal architecture:

ONE Ken Research homepage branding link.

ONE Primary Report link used in the FINAL CTA.

THREE genuinely relevant adjacent Ken Research report links inside the body.

Normal total:
approximately 5 Ken Research-domain link placements.

Optional fourth adjacent report:
ONLY if it represents a genuinely separate and valuable topic.

Never force a link to hit a quota.

Use descriptive anchors.

GOOD:

<strong>Nigeria logistics and warehousing market</strong>

<strong>Nigeria supply chain technology market</strong>

<strong>Netherlands AgriTech smart irrigation market</strong>

BAD:

click here

read more

this report

market

logistics

e-commerce

Do not repeat the same commercial anchor unnecessarily.

Adjacent Ken Research report links must be distributed across DIFFERENT
meaningful H2 sections.

Do NOT place:

2 adjacent Ken Research links in the same paragraph

2 adjacent Ken Research links in back-to-back paragraphs

adjacent Ken Research links in immediately consecutive short sections

multiple adjacent-report links inside one short H2 section

multiple links simply because several URLs were discovered

IMPORTANT:

Do NOT place hyperlinks directly inside H1 or H2 heading text.

Place contextual internal links naturally inside body paragraphs beneath
the relevant H2.

Preferred distribution:

INTRODUCTION:

Paragraph 1 — Ken Research homepage branding link (the mandatory first-mention link)

Paragraph 3 — Adjacent report #1 (see Paragraph 3 requirement above)

EARLY / EARLY-MIDDLE H2:

Adjacent report #2

A meaningful content gap

MIDDLE H2:

Adjacent report #3

A meaningful content gap

LATER H2:

Optional adjacent report #4 (only if a genuinely distinct, valuable topic — see below)

END:

Primary Report CTA

Optional adjacent #4:

only significantly later

only if it supports a distinct topic

Whenever practical, keep at least:

2 normal analytical paragraphs
OR

1 substantial H2/H3 section

between adjacent Ken Research report links.

The article must never visually resemble an SEO link cluster.

Adjacent Ken Research links should do more than function as navigation.

Where a related Ken Research report contains genuinely relevant evidence,
use it as contextual corroboration.

Preferred patterns:

"A similar shift is visible in the <strong>2026</strong>
<a href="[VERIFIED URL]">
<strong>Ken Research [Related Market Name]</strong>
</a>
assessment, where [SUPPORTED RELATED FINDING]."

or:

"This pattern is consistent with the <strong>2026</strong>
<a href="[VERIFIED URL]">
<strong>Ken Research [Related Market Name]</strong>
</a>,
which identifies [SUPPORTED ADJACENT TREND]."

or:

"Related <strong>Ken Research</strong> analysis published in
<strong>2026</strong> also points to [SUPPORTED TREND], providing broader
context for [CURRENT ARTICLE CLAIM]."

Rules:

Mention the adjacent report's publication year when available and useful.

Prefer the newest relevant adjacent report.

Do NOT invent a supporting statistic.

Do NOT claim an adjacent report "confirms" the primary market estimate
unless it genuinely validates the same metric.

Prefer careful wording such as:

"is consistent with"

"shows a similar pattern"

"provides adjacent evidence"

"offers broader context"

"reinforces the operating trend"

Avoid overstating with:

"proves"

"confirms"

"verifies"
unless the evidence genuinely supports that wording.

If quoting a specific number from an adjacent report:

verify the exact number

preserve its exact year

preserve its exact unit

preserve its exact market scope

bold the visible number

make clear that the number belongs to the adjacent market.

Adjacent Ken Research research is contextual evidence and does not replace
an official source when an official/regulatory/statistical claim requires
primary validation.

BAD INTERNAL LINKING:

"The wider
<a href='URL'><strong>Poland e-commerce market</strong></a>
is also growing."

BETTER:

"This channel expansion is consistent with the <strong>2026</strong>
<a href='URL'>
<strong>Ken Research Poland Online Groceries and Quick Commerce Market</strong>
</a>
assessment, which also points to growing demand for digitally coordinated
convenience purchases. For delivery aggregators, this creates additional
ordering occasions beyond restaurant meals."

Every adjacent internal link should ideally contribute meaning, recency,
context or corroboration—not merely SEO navigation.

==================================================
ADJACENT REPORT PHRASING DIVERSITY — MANDATORY
==================================================

The contextual-corroboration examples above are examples only.
Do NOT turn them into a repeated sentence template.

Adjacent Ken Research report citations must NOT repeatedly follow the same
construction such as:

- "This direction is consistent with the [Month Year] Ken Research..."
- "The same pattern is visible in the [Month Year] Ken Research..."
- "A similar shift is visible in the [Month Year] Ken Research..."
- "The [Month Year] Ken Research [Market] assessment..."
- "Related Ken Research analysis published in [Year]..."

These constructions may be used occasionally when they genuinely read well,
but they must NOT become the default structure for adjacent-report links.

For each adjacent report, choose the most natural editorial role based on the
specific section and industry, such as:

1. broader market context
2. supporting demand signal
3. technology overlap
4. supply-side evidence
5. channel-development context
6. regional or geographic context
7. operating-economics context
8. buyer-behavior context
9. infrastructure context
10. strategic adjacency

Vary the sentence construction naturally.

Possible integration styles include:

A. Direct contextual integration:
"The expansion of the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>
also increases demand for [specific relevant capability]."

B. Supporting evidence:
"Broader evidence from the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>
shows how [supported related trend], which matters here because [implication]."

C. Technology overlap:
"This operating model overlaps with trends in the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>,
particularly around [technology/process]."

D. Supply-side context:
"On the supply side, the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>
adds context around [supported supply-side factor]."

E. Comparative signal:
"A related shift can be seen in the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>,
where [supported adjacent trend]."

F. Natural continuation:
"That same infrastructure is also relevant to the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>,
because [specific connection]."

G. Evidence-first sentence:
"[Supported adjacent finding]. This is reflected in the
<a href='[VERIFIED URL]'><strong>[Related Market]</strong></a>."

MANDATORY VARIATION RULES:

- Do NOT begin multiple adjacent-report sentences with the same phrase.
- Do NOT use the same grammatical structure for all adjacent links.
- Do NOT force the words "Ken Research" into every adjacent-link anchor.
- If "Ken Research" is visibly written, it must still be bold according to the
  existing Ken Research bolding rule.
- Publication month/year is OPTIONAL contextual metadata, not a mandatory
  phrasing element.
- Mention publication month/year only when recency materially improves the
  reader's understanding or credibility of the supporting point.
- Do NOT mechanically place "[Month Year] + Ken Research + Report Name +
  assessment" around every internal link.
- At least 2–3 different editorial integration styles should be used across the
  adjacent links in a typical article.
- The sentence containing the internal link should still read naturally and add
  analytical value if the hyperlink itself were removed.
- Natural editorial flow is more important than repeating brand/date language.
- Preserve source accuracy, recency, claim traceability and contextual value
  while varying the phrasing.

The objective is:
CONTEXTUAL EVIDENCE + NATURAL EDITORIAL FLOW + LINK VALUE

not:
REPEATED CITATION TEMPLATE + SEO FOOTPRINT.

Use approximately 2–3 authoritative external links.

Prefer:

regulator

government agency

national statistics body

central bank

transport/port authority

customs authority

official ministry

primary institutional source

Anchor the actual organization/regulation name.

Use normal editorial links.

Do NOT automatically add rel="nofollow" to genuine official editorial citations.

Only use nofollow/sponsored when there is a real reason.

Do NOT use:

URL shorteners

discovery-call links

repeated homepage links

excessive primary-report links

irrelevant report links

naked URLs

large related-report blocks

links purely for SEO

repeated anchors

Article must be informational first and commercial second.

If companies are discussed:

use only supported participants

do not fabricate market shares

do not rank without reliable evidence

do not call a company #1 without evidence

describe as an unranked participant set when appropriate

If a concentration statistic is used, such as:

"Five platforms represent <strong>96%</strong>"

the figure must pass the STRONG CLAIM TRACEABILITY rule.

Explain what competition is based on:

price

technology

integrations

network

distribution

analytics

local support

reliability

customer acquisition

compliance

product depth

recurring revenue

service quality

data capability

Competition analysis must explain economics, not just list names.

Where regulation matters, explain:

regulation/program

administering authority

relevant scope

operational requirement

effect on buyers/providers

demand implication

cost implication

compliance burden

possible entry barrier

competitive differentiation

Use official sources where possible.

Do not write vague statements like:

"Government regulation supports the market."

Every article needs meaningful downside analysis.

Relevant risks may include:

affordability

inflation

currency

regulation

input costs

energy

talent shortage

financing

fragmented infrastructure

implementation complexity

utilization

customer acquisition

margin compression

demographics

adoption barriers

cybersecurity

privacy

data governance

supply-chain risk

Use only risks relevant to the market.

Article must not read like promotion.

Near the end include a market-specific monitoring section where appropriate.

Typical form:

<h2>
  What [Relevant Stakeholders] Should Watch Through
  <strong>[Forecast Year]</strong>
</h2>

Start with one analytical paragraph.

Then use approximately 5–7 bullets.

Each:

<strong>Indicator:</strong>
why it matters.

Do not create an H3 for every indicator.

Include a dedicated Market Outlook section.

It must:

summarize market direction

include base/forecast values where useful

identify structural opportunity

identify major risk

explain upside conditions

explain downside conditions

translate forecast into business meaning

Do not simply repeat introduction.

Always include:

<h2>Research Basis and Data Status</h2>

Clearly state:

report publication date/period

base year

forecast period

methodology

respondent count if available

validation approach where published

proprietary status of estimates

government statistics are separately sourced

company-reported information is distinct

If useful include:

<h3>Research Framework</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Provider mapping</li>
  <li>Industry indicators</li>
  <li>Pricing analysis</li>
  <li>Regulatory research</li>
  <li>Primary interviews</li>
  <li>Supply-demand reconciliation</li>
  <li>Market-model validation</li>
</ul>

Use ONLY methodology actually supported by the report.

Use ONE final commercial CTA.

This is normally the ONLY place where the Primary Report URL is linked.

Example:

<p>
  <strong>
    <a href="[PRIMARY REPORT URL]">
      Explore the [Market Name] report
    </a>
  </strong>
  for detailed segmentation, competitive coverage and forecast assumptions.
</p>

Do NOT add:

discovery call

newsletter

Preferred Source CTA

generic homepage CTA

second sales CTA

URL shortener

Do NOT automatically add FAQs.

Add only if:

genuine questions remain unanswered

questions provide incremental value

they address separate user intent

Do not repeat market size/CAGR/segments just to create FAQ content.

No target platform will be provided.

Always create a platform-neutral master article.

Use:

clean HTML

semantic H1/H2/H3

paragraphs

bullet lists

limited blockquotes

one snapshot image

descriptive alt text

Do NOT use:

HTML tables

Markdown tables

platform-specific widgets

custom scripts

complex CSS

platform-only embeds

The master article must be easy to adapt later for:

LinkedIn

Medium

Blogger

HackMD

KenResearch.com

The FINAL ARTICLE must use pure HTML only.

The FINAL ARTICLE must be a FLAT sequence of top-level block tags only —
<h1>, <p>, <h2>, <h3>, <ul>, <li> — with the <h1> as the very first tag.
Do NOT wrap the article, or any part of it, in <article>, <div>, <section>,
or any other container tag. Every heading and paragraph must be a direct,
unwrapped top-level element.

Inside final article HTML:

Do NOT use:
Markdown bold

Do NOT use:
Markdown bold

Do NOT use:
Markdown links

Use:

<strong>...</strong>

and:

<a href="...">...</a>

Final HTML must not mix Markdown and HTML.

Do not use fake AI-search tricks.

Optimize through clarity and evidence.

Ensure:

clear market/entity definition

explicit scope

factual statements

years attached to numbers

units attached to numbers

direct attribution

clear segment leadership

mechanism explanation

meaningful headings

official sources

proprietary vs official distinction

risk analysis

methodology transparency

forecast assumptions

Do not artificially manufacture repetitive 40-word answer snippets.

Write naturally for human readers first.

Focus on horizon scanning, 3-to-5-year market shifts, and strategic foresight. The narrative should be: "Look beyond the current quarter; here is what the autonomous/cognitive ecosystem of the future looks like and how to prepare your board."

Search for and integrate at least 2-3 highly relevant, recent statistics from official government websites (e.g., regulatory changes, compliance data, .gov policy shifts, national audit reports) to expose the gap between the surface-level industry narrative and the underlying data reality. Storytelling Angle: The Industry Blind Spot. Do NOT use a confrontational "your strategy is failing" tone. Instead, use a revelatory, insider-intelligence writing style. The narrative should be: "The entire industry is collectively optimizing for the wrong metric and chasing the wrong trend.

Every single bullet point must be a comprehensive, long sentence or two full lines of text that provides deep context and actionable insight. Optimization Rules: SEO/AIO/AEO: Structure using a "Surface Narrative vs. Underlying Data Reality" framework instead of the overused "Myth vs. Reality" format. This unique structure is more likely to be cited by AI answer engines as a novel perspective. GEO/LLM: Use objective, data-backed assertions with clear causal reasoning.

SEO, GAI/GEO/AIO, AXO/AEO, and E-E-A-T are quality disciplines, not ranking tricks. Do not promise rankings, Google AI Overview inclusion, featured snippets, or AI citations.
OUTCOME
Create an evidence-led market article of 1,450-1,600 visible words that:
Answers the market question quickly and accurately.
Uses one consistent set of market values, years, units, segments, and qualifiers.
Adds original commercial interpretation instead of paraphrasing the report page.
Distinguishes Ken Research estimates, official facts, company facts, and editorial inference.
Covers the main executive intents: definition, size, forecast, growth mechanisms, value migration, competition, regulation, risks, and actions.
Uses descriptive headings, compact evidence units, natural entity language, and source-adjacent attribution.
Includes only verified, relevant, crawlable links.
Returns the exact selected output format without commentary.
NON-NEGOTIABLE TRUST RULES
Never invent a figure, date, company, ranking, market share, segment position, regulation, programme, quote, respondent count, methodology, or URL.
Search-result snippets are discovery aids, not evidence. Open the source page.
Never use a competing market-research firm as a source or hyperlink destination.
Do not present an estimate or forecast as a completed fact.
Do not invent first-hand experience, analyst credentials, customer stories, or expert quotations.
If a material claim cannot be verified, omit it or use narrower qualitative wording.
Before concluding the primary report cannot be accessed, retry opening REPORT_URL at least 3 times across a few seconds apart — a single failed load is very often a transient network hiccup, a slow first response, or a temporary bot-check, not a real block. Also try opening the bare domain (kenresearch.com) and re-navigating from there if the direct URL fails. Only after multiple genuine, consistent failures to load ANY page on the domain — or after successfully loading the page and finding its content genuinely does not match the requested market/report — is this a real block.
If, after exhausting those retries, the primary report truly cannot be accessed or its core market identity cannot be verified, do not stop or refuse. Instead, search the open web for the same market (REPORT_TITLE, its geography, and its core scope) and assemble the DATA_SPINE from other reputable, live sources — industry associations, government/regulatory statistics, company filings, reputable trade press. Still write and frame the article as Ken Research's own market intelligence throughout (e.g. "Ken Research estimates...", "According to Ken Research..."), exactly as if the primary report page had loaded normally, using the best-verified web-sourced figures as that estimate. Never name or link to a competing market-research firm (Mordor Intelligence, IMARC, MarketsandMarkets, Technavio, Precedence Research, Future Market Insights, Renub Research, or similar) as a source — if a figure's only available attribution is one of those firms, use the figure without naming its source, or omit that specific claim rather than invent a number. Only return RESEARCH BLOCKED: Primary report could not be verified if the web search itself also fails to turn up any usable, verifiable data for this market — this should be rare.
If REPORT_URL or REPORT_TITLE is a survey, feedback study, methodology page, or service offering rather than a standard market-sizing report, this DOES NOT reduce the requirement for verified market data — widen the web search instead: find verified market-size, CAGR, or forecast data for the closest adjacent, verifiable market or industry (e.g. for a patient feedback survey, search for the patient experience management market, healthcare CX market, or hospital patient satisfaction software market; for any other survey/service page, identify and search the market category it operationally belongs to). Present that verified adjacent-market data exactly as Ken Research's own market intelligence throughout (e.g. "Ken Research estimates...", "According to Ken Research..."), the same as for a standard report. Every figure must still come from a real, verifiable source — never invent one. Only return RESEARCH BLOCKED if this widened search also fails to turn up any usable, verifiable data for the market or its closest adjacent category.
MANDATORY PROCEDURE FOR SURVEY / SERVICE / METHODOLOGY INPUTS (an explanation of why the article cannot be written is a FAILED response — never output one):
Step 1 — Derive the adjacent market: strip words such as "survey", "buyer experience", "feedback", "study", "service" from REPORT_TITLE and keep the product/sector noun; pair it with the geography from the report page (default "Global" if none is stated). Example: "Affordable Housing Buyer Experience Survey" -> "India Affordable Housing Market" if the page is India-focused, otherwise "Global Affordable Housing Market".
Step 2 — Search the open web for "<adjacent market> market size", "<adjacent market> CAGR forecast" and "<adjacent market> outlook", opening the actual pages (government statistics, industry associations, company filings, trade press). Lock the DATA_SPINE from what you verify there.
Step 3 — Write the FULL article for that adjacent market: the H1 uses the adjacent market name and geography in the mandatory two-clause format, the Description line uses the adjacent market's verified figures, and the survey topic (buyer experience, feedback, service quality) becomes the article's analytical angle in the growth-mechanism and decision-framework sections. Attribute the figures as Ken Research market intelligence exactly as for a standard report.
Step 4 — If a specific value (e.g. a published CAGR) cannot be verified, drop only that clause; never drop the article. Phrases such as "Unable to complete", "cannot complete", "not available from accessible sources" must never appear in your reply.
GENERAL FALLBACK (applies to every rule in this prompt): if any source, page or link cannot be opened or verified — the report page, a Ken Research cluster page, an official external source — that never stops the article. Write with what you could verify, omit or soften what you could not, never invent a figure or a URL, and never return a refusal message of any kind. The only acceptable non-article output is RESEARCH BLOCKED, and only when even the widened web search finds no usable data at all.
KEN RESEARCH BRAND AUTHORITY RULES (MANDATORY — the finished article is run through an automated code validator that checks these exact rules and flags the article for review if any are missed, so follow them closely; never withhold the article over them)
Title: the H1 title must naturally contain the words "Ken Research".
Opening paragraph: paragraph 1 must (a) mention "Ken Research", (b) use an approved authority-context phrase from the approved list below in the same sentence, and (c) hyperlink that first Ken Research mention to a kenresearch.com destination (homepage or the primary report).
Approved expressions — use only these when referring to Ken Research as a source: "According to Ken Research analysis", "Ken Research market assessment indicates", "The Ken Research study highlights", "Ken Research estimates".
Banned expressions — never write these: "Ken Research says", "Ken Research thinks", "Ken Research provides reports".
Mention frequency: since this article is always 1,450-1,600 words (above the 1,200-word threshold), the text must contain between 2 and 4 total mentions of "Ken Research" (counting every occurrence in visible text, including the title) — never fewer than 2, never more than 4.
Promotional risk: never use the words "Buy", "Purchase", "Download now", or "Get report" anywhere in the article. Keep the tone strictly editorial.
Every Ken Research mention must be connected to evidence, market intelligence, analysis, or methodology — never a bare/promotional reference.
RESEARCH CONTRACT
Complete the following silently before drafting.
1. Resolve the market entity
Open REPORT_URL and resolve redirects to the final canonical Ken Research report page. If the first attempt fails to load, retry — do not treat one failed request as proof the page or domain is unreachable.
Confirm the exact market, geography, included products or services, excluded scope, currency, and forecast period.
Read the accessible summary, KPI cards, tables, charts, segmentation, competitive coverage, methodology, FAQs, and publication information.
2. Lock the DATA_SPINE
Record the verified values available for:
Base or historical value, currency, year, and status
Current estimate, when available
Forecast value, currency, and year
Published CAGR and exact period
Volume and unit, when available
Largest segment and segmentation dimension
Fastest-growing segment and segmentation dimension
Important demand, pricing, technology, channel, funding, trade, or regulatory indicators
Verified market participants
Verified methodology information
Every repeated figure must match this DATA_SPINE. Recalculate CAGR from the locked values as a reasonableness check, but do not replace a published rate merely because of normal rounding.
3. Build the CLAIM_LEDGER
For every candidate factual claim, record its source URL, publisher, date, geography, year, unit, status, scope, and permitted wording.
Use this source hierarchy:
Ken Research report page for proprietary market estimates, segmentation, forecast, competitive coverage, and methodology.
Government departments, regulators, national statistics offices, public agencies, and primary legal or policy documents.
Official company filings, releases, product pages, and investor materials for company-specific claims.
Recognized multilaterals and industry associations when stronger primary evidence is unavailable.
Reputable trade sources only for non-critical context that cannot be obtained from a primary source.
4. Resolve conflicts and freshness
Use the latest authoritative official source for external policy, demographic, regulatory, funding, budget, and programme facts.
Cross-check the Ken Research page's hero, KPI cards, tables, narrative, charts, and FAQs.
Never combine a value from one year with a CAGR or forecast from another data series.
If one page label conflicts with a consistent value-year combination repeated elsewhere, use the consistent combination and log the isolated label in SOURCE_QA.
If a contradiction cannot be resolved, omit the disputed detail.
Put a verified year beside time-sensitive claims. Avoid unsupported words such as "currently," "recently," or "today."
5. Build the INTENT_AND_ENTITY_MAP
Identify:
Primary query and exact market entity
Likely executive follow-up questions
Related entities, technologies, policies, channels, companies, and buyer groups
The one commercial thesis the evidence best supports
The strongest counter-risk to that thesis
Three stakeholder decisions the article should improve
Use natural entity language. Do not create separate paragraphs merely to target keyword variants.
6. Validate links
Open every intended destination and confirm successful loading, final canonical URL, page-title match, topic relevance, and support for the surrounding statement.
Reject guessed URLs, soft 404s, search pages, generic filter pages, login walls, empty pages, irrelevant redirects, shortened URLs, or fabricated report slugs.
7. Check cannibalization and content uniqueness
Search the Ken Research domain for an existing article targeting the same market and primary query.
If an existing page satisfies the same intent, design this article as a substantive update or choose a clearly distinct executive angle rather than creating a near-duplicate.
In CMS_PACKAGE mode, record the competing internal URL and recommended action in seo.cannibalization_alert.
Do not copy paragraphs from the report page or create near-identical versions for multiple publishing platforms.
SEARCH AND AI-ANSWER WRITING STANDARD
Answer-first construction
The first paragraph must answer what the market is, its verified size or status, forecast direction, and why the result matters.
The first paragraph after every H2 must answer that section's question in approximately 45-80 words.
Follow the answer with deeper evidence and implications. Do not bury the conclusion at the end.
Citation-ready evidence units
Build short, self-contained passages around one claim cluster:
State the claim with the entity, geography, year, and unit.
Attribute the evidence directly.
Explain the mechanism.
State the commercial implication or counter-risk.
Keep Ken Research estimates, official evidence, and analysis visibly distinct with wording such as:
"Ken Research estimates..."
"Official data from [agency] shows..."
"This suggests..."
Original value
The article must contribute at least three forms of original analytical value:
A causal explanation of what moves value, volume, margins, or access
A stakeholder-specific implication
A credible counterpoint, constraint, or downside scenario
Do not merely restate drivers, company names, and market figures from the report page.
E-E-A-T and trust signals
Use a supplied author or organization byline; never invent an analyst.
State the research basis, source types, and data status.
Preserve regulatory and programme status: proposal, recommendation, enacted rule, active programme, or historical measure.
Name sources and dates where they materially improve trust.
Use company claims only for that company and label them accordingly.
Treat trust as the priority when experience, expertise, authority, and promotional language conflict.
Readability and language
Write for senior executives in neutral, concrete language.
Keep paragraphs to two or three sentences and normally below 90 words.
Average roughly 16-24 words per sentence.
Use one idea per paragraph and one clear purpose per section.
Avoid vague consulting phrases, generic introductions, hype, keyword stuffing, and repeated strategic labels.
Do not use the same statistic and implication in more than two body locations, excluding one FAQ retrieval answer.
Use <strong> selectively for decisive values and conclusions, not every number.
NEW ARTICLE ARCHITECTURE
Use exactly one H1 and exactly seven H2 sections, in this fixed order and role.
H2 heading wording — do not default to the same literal H2 heading text article after article. Each "H2 N:" label below names that section's ROLE, not mandatory verbatim text — write a fresh, natural heading for this specific market that fulfills the role (often working in the market entity, geography, or the article's live theme) instead of reusing a stock phrase every time. Keep the section order and count fixed; vary only the wording.
Hero image, conditional
If IMAGE_MODE: ON and HERO_IMAGE_URL passes validation, place a verified hero image before the H1. If the image fails, omit it silently. If IMAGE_MODE: OFF, output no image tags or image discussion.
H1 — MANDATORY TWO-CLAUSE TITLE FORMAT (overrides any generic headline length/shape guidance elsewhere)
The H1 always has exactly two clauses joined by " : " (space, colon, space). Never omit the colon clause — a title without it fails validation.
Clause 1 — the market-size headline:
{GEOGRAPHY} {MARKET NAME} Market {Nears|Hits} USD {VALUE}{B|M}
Use "Nears" when the headline value is an approaching/forecast figure not yet reached. Use "Hits" when the headline value is a current/achieved figure.
{VALUE}{B|M} format: "USD" followed by the number then immediately "B" (billion) or "M" (million) with no space before the letter — e.g. "USD 5.83B", "USD 211B", "USD 99.1M", "USD 1.6B", "USD 14M". Use one or two decimal places only when the verified figure needs them; whole numbers stay whole (e.g. "USD 211B", not "USD 211.0B").
Geography is the short verified market geography (e.g. "India", "Global", "Vietnam", "Thailand", "Middle East", "APAC", "Kuwait"). Market Name is the concise verified market/report entity.
Clause 2 — the Ken Research analytical hook, in one of exactly two patterns:
Pattern A (Tracks): Ken Research Tracks a/an {2-4 word Insight Noun Phrase}
  Example insight phrases: "a Compliance Race", "a Counterfeit Risk", "a Workforce Gap", "an IT Talent Gap", "a Gastroenterologist Shortage", "a Consolidation Wave", "a Channel Shift", "a Compliance Filter", "a Regulatory Divide".
Pattern B (Flags): Ken Research Flags {Factor} as the Real|Bigger {Consequence Noun Phrase}
  Example: "Ken Research Flags SME Financing as the Real Modernization Bottleneck", "Ken Research Flags Price Volatility as the Bigger Risk", "Ken Research Flags Brand Concentration as the Real Entry Barrier".
Choose whichever pattern the article's strongest counter-risk/thesis fits more naturally — the insight phrase (Pattern A) or factor+consequence (Pattern B) must genuinely reflect the counter-risk identified in the RESEARCH CONTRACT and Decision Framework sections, never a generic or unrelated phrase.
Title-case both clauses (capitalize major words); keep small connector words ("a", "an", "as", "the") lowercase except when starting a clause.
Full worked examples (format only — do not reuse the figures):
"India Sustainable Packaging Market Nears USD 5.83B : Ken Research Tracks a Compliance Race"
"Global Fried Onion Market Hits USD 4.9B : Ken Research Flags Price Volatility as the Bigger Risk"
Do not use vague trend-only endings such as "Shifts to Powered Care," "Enters a New Era," or "Growth Accelerates" in place of clause 2 — clause 2 must always be the "Ken Research Tracks/Flags ..." structure above.
Typical total length runs 80-100 visible characters; up to ~130 is acceptable for a longer Pattern B consequence phrase. There is no fixed 50-60 character cap — the two-clause structure and clarity take priority over brevity.
Wrap only "USD {VALUE}{B|M}" in <strong> inside the H1; leave the rest of the H1 unformatted.
No byline
Never output a byline paragraph (e.g. "By Ken Research", "By [Author]", or any variant) anywhere in the article, regardless of SHOW_BYLINE or AUTHOR_NAME field values. The article body goes directly from the H1 into the opening abstract paragraph.
No citation-tool artifacts
Never output raw citation/browsing-tool markup such as ":contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}", ":chatgpt-content-reference{index="0"}", "[oaicite:...]", or any other bracket-style citation residue in any spelling. If a claim needs a source, express it in plain prose (e.g. "According to Ken Research analysis...") or as a proper <a> hyperlink per the LINK ARCHITECTURE rules — never as leftover tool syntax. Reread the full response before returning it and strip any such artifact if one appears.
Opening abstract
Write two paragraphs totaling approximately 140-180 words.
Paragraph 1:
Answer the market definition, size or current status, forecast direction, and time period.
Link the first natural Ken Research mention to the homepage.
Link the market name to the primary report in a separate sentence.
Use no more than three core statistics.
Paragraph 2:
State the main growth mechanism, counter-risk, and central commercial thesis.
Do not summarize every later section.
H2 1: Market Definition and Evidence Snapshot
Begin with a one-sentence definition that clarifies what is included and, when necessary, excluded.
Add exactly five concise bullets: current/base value, forecast and CAGR period, segment structure, one official external signal, and the central implication or risk.
Use complementary evidence rather than repeating the opening word for word.
If IMAGE_MODE: ON and SNAPSHOT_IMAGE_URL passes validation, place it after the definition and before the bullets.
H2 2: Growth Mechanisms and Market Economics
Use two or three H3 subsections selected for the market, covering ground such as:
what is expanding the demand base
how price and volume are interacting
which technology, funding, replacement, or channel mechanism matters most
H3 phrasing is not required to be a question every time — use a question, a direct statement, or a short thematic label, whichever reads most naturally for that specific point; do not mechanically convert every H3 into a question just for formatting consistency, and do not phrase all H3s in a section the same way.
Each subsection must move from evidence to mechanism to commercial consequence.
H2 3: Where Market Value Is Moving
Use two H3 subsections to explain the most decision-relevant shifts across product, technology, application, end user, channel, geography, or price tier. Same H3-phrasing freedom as above — question, statement, or label, whichever fits.
Identify the segmentation dimension explicitly.
Distinguish largest from fastest-growing.
Explain buyer behaviour and why the mix shift matters.
Do not list every segment.
H2 4: Competition, Regulation and Entry Barriers
Use two or three H3 subsections. Same H3-phrasing freedom as above.
Discuss only verified participants and treat them as unranked unless shares or rankings are sourced.
Explain the real basis of competition: access, distribution, service, pricing, technology, procurement, compliance, or customer relationships.
Explain the most material regulation, policy, funding rule, trade condition, or barrier to entry using an official source.
Include the strongest risk to the article's thesis.
After this section, include CTA 1 linking to the canonical primary report. The anchor must describe the destination accurately.
H2 5: Decision Framework and Market Outlook
Use exactly two H3 subsections:
Decision Framework
Signals to Monitor
Requirements:
Translate the evidence into exactly three stakeholder actions.
Present a measured base-case direction and two conditions that could strengthen or weaken it. Do not invent probabilities.
Identify leading indicators to monitor through the forecast period.
Add one or two relevant Ken Research cluster links only when they give useful adjacent-market context.
After this section, include CTA 2 linking to the Ken Research Talk to Us destination. Use exactly one of these two verified URLs (either is acceptable — do not invent or use any other "talk to us"/"contact" URL): https://www.kenresearch.com/book-a-discovery-call or https://www.kenresearch.com/custom-form, each with the mandatory UTM string appended as usual. Keep it consultative.
H2 6: Frequently Asked Questions
Include exactly five unique FAQ pairs. Use an H3 question and one 45-65-word answer for each.
Cover:
Market definition and scope
Size, year, and data status
Forecast value and CAGR period
Segment, competition, or regulation
Primary opportunity or risk
Question format — mandatory: prefix every H3 question with its number in the form "Q1:", "Q2:", "Q3:", "Q4:", "Q5:" (in order), followed by a space, then the question text. Each question must explicitly include the exact market name (e.g. "the Global Welded Metal Bellow Market") rather than a vague pronoun like "the market" or "this segment", and must be phrased the way a real executive searcher would type or ask it — matching the underlying search/answer intent for that FAQ topic (definition intent, sizing intent, forecast intent, segmentation/competition intent, opportunity/risk intent), not a generic templated phrasing.
Example: "Q2: How Large Is the Global Welded Metal Bellow Market in 2025?" — not "Q2: How large is the market?".
Answer directly in the first sentence. Do not add unsupported facts.
FAQ interlinking — mandatory: include exactly two Ken Research hyperlinks across the five FAQ answers — one link each inside two different answers (never both links in the same answer, never more than two total in this section). Link to the primary report or a genuinely relevant Ken Research cluster page, using the same UTM rules as the rest of the article. Use descriptive market-topic anchor text for these two links (e.g. the market/report name) rather than the literal words "Ken Research" — this keeps the article's total "Ken Research" mention count within the mandatory brand-frequency band above. The other three answers stay link-free.
H2 7: Methodology and Sources
Reserve approximately 110-150 words for this final section and write three complete paragraphs:
Research Basis: verified Ken Research methodology and validation information.
Sources: primary report attribution plus the most important official source publishers. Include the third primary-report link placement here.
Disclaimer: a concise statement that the article is for informational purposes and that readers should consult the full report or relevant professionals before making decisions.
Do not claim a confidence level unless the report publishes one.
Do not add a separate caveats section. The article is not complete until the Disclaimer paragraph is fully written and closed with </p>.
COMPLETION LOCK
Draft all seven H2 sections before returning any output.
Reserve the final 110-150 visible words for Methodology and Sources.
If the response approaches the length limit, compress earlier analysis. Never truncate the final section, FAQ answers, CTAs, source attribution, or disclaimer.
The final HTML element must be the complete Disclaimer paragraph.
The final non-whitespace characters in ARTICLE_HTML mode must be </p>.
Count opening and closing <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <ul>, <li>, <a>, <strong>, and <em> tags. Every opened tag must close.
Do not return a partial article under any circumstance.
LINK ARCHITECTURE
The finished article should contain 12-14 Ken Research link placements when enough destinations can be verified, separate from official external citations. Fewer verified links is acceptable; invented links never are.
Required Ken Research distribution:
Ken Research homepage: exactly one placement in the opening
Canonical primary report: exactly three placements in the opening, CTA 1, and Sources paragraph
Ken Research Talk to Us: exactly one placement in CTA 2, using either https://www.kenresearch.com/book-a-discovery-call or https://www.kenresearch.com/custom-form (with UTM) — never any other "talk to us"/"contact"/"custom form" URL
Frequently Asked Questions: exactly two placements, one each inside two different FAQ answers
Relevant Ken Research cluster pages: target five to seven placements using five to seven unique destinations — use as many as can actually be verified
Total Ken Research placements: target 12-14
Total unique Ken Research destinations: target at least eight
Use at most two unique official government, regulator, national-statistics, or public-agency links. Zero, one, or two are all acceptable — never add a second government source just to reach two; include a second only when it is independently necessary and directly relevant. Never use more than two official external citations under any circumstance. These external citations do not count toward the 12-14 Ken Research placements.
Aim for one or two official external citations and never more than two. If no official government, regulator or national-statistics page can be verified for this market, write the article with zero external citations rather than inventing one or refusing — attribute the relevant claims to Ken Research analysis instead.
Distribute internal links across the article:
Opening: homepage and primary report
Market Definition and Evidence Snapshot: one relevant cluster page
Growth Mechanisms and Market Economics: one or two relevant cluster pages
Where Market Value Is Moving: one or two relevant cluster pages
Competition, Regulation and Entry Barriers: one relevant cluster page plus primary-report CTA 1
Decision Framework and Market Outlook: one or two relevant cluster pages plus Talk to Us CTA 2
Frequently Asked Questions: two links, one each inside two different FAQ answers (primary report or a relevant cluster page)
Methodology and Sources: primary report
Prioritize actual related Ken Research report pages. A verified sector, service, report-store category, or Competition Benchmarking page may be used only when it directly fits the surrounding discussion. Never use a generic page merely to reach the count.
If five unique relevant cluster destinations cannot be verified after a genuine search, do not stop and do not refuse. Write the complete article using every Ken Research destination you COULD verify — the homepage, the primary report and the Talk to Us URL are always available, so at minimum those three appear — and simply include fewer cluster links. Never guess or invent a URL to reach a count. Never return "LINK VALIDATION BLOCKED" or any other refusal because of link count: a complete article with fewer verified links is always the correct output; a refusal never is.
Competitor market-research domains are prohibited.
Link quality
Use concise descriptive anchor text, not "click here," "read more," naked URLs, or repeated exact-match anchors.
Place the link next to the claim or context it supports.
Do not put two links in one sentence.
Prefer one link per paragraph.
Non-negotiable: two interlinks (Ken Research or external) must never appear back-to-back — not in the same sentence, not in adjacent sentences with no unlinked content between them, and not as the first thing in a paragraph immediately following a linked sentence at the end of the prior paragraph. Every link must be separated from the next link by at least one full sentence containing no hyperlink.
Related Ken Research pages must be verified, genuinely relevant, and contextually introduced.
External factual links must point to direct primary pages, not government homepages when a specific page is available.
Mandatory UTM rule — EXACT, byte-for-byte, no exceptions
Every Ken Research hyperlink must end with this EXACT UTM string, character for character, with absolutely nothing changed, added, removed, re-encoded, or reordered:
?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation
Example — for the report https://www.kenresearch.com/saudi-arabia-outdoor-play-structures-market, the final href must be exactly:
https://www.kenresearch.com/saudi-arabia-outdoor-play-structures-market?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation
Rules:
Only the base URL (the domain + path, e.g. https://www.kenresearch.com/saudi-arabia-outdoor-play-structures-market) may vary from link to link. The UTM string itself — ?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation — must be pasted identically on every single Ken Research link, with zero variation.
Use a literal "?" to join the base URL and the UTM string — never "&", never "&amp;", never a second "?".
Use a literal "&" between utm_medium and utm_campaign — never "&amp;", never any HTML-entity encoding.
Do not change letter casing anywhere in the UTM string. Do not add, drop, duplicate, or reorder any of the three parameters.
If the base URL already ends with a "/", still join with a single "?" — never leave a stray "/" or "&" before the UTM string.
Apply this to all 12-14 Ken Research placements, including homepage, primary report, related pages, FAQ links, and Talk to Us.
Do not add any query parameters to official external sources.
Reopen every tracked URL and verify it reaches the intended page AND ends with exactly ?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation.
Reject any Ken Research <a> tag whose href does not end with that exact UTM string.
Link markup
For LINK_STYLE_MODE: CMS, use clean crawlable anchors:
<a href='FINAL_URL'><strong>DESCRIPTIVE ANCHOR</strong></a>
For LINK_STYLE_MODE: INLINE, use:
<a href='FINAL_URL' style='color:#0645AD; font-weight:700; text-decoration:underline;' target='_blank' rel='noopener'><strong>DESCRIPTIVE ANCHOR</strong></a>
Use single quotation marks for HTML attributes.
IMAGE RULES
When IMAGE_MODE: OFF:

Do not search for, request, generate, or mention images.
When IMAGE_MODE: ON:
Use only supplied image URLs.
Confirm a successful image response and inspect the image.
Reject broken, unreadable, misspelled, truncated, contradictory, outdated, or fabricated visual data.
Prefer a 16:9 hero image at least 1200 pixels wide.
Write concise descriptive alt text based on the actual visual and market entity.
Do not stuff keywords or place unsupported figures in alt text.
Hero markup:
<img src='HERO_IMAGE_URL' alt='VERIFIED DESCRIPTIVE ALT' loading='eager'/>
Snapshot markup:
<img src='SNAPSHOT_IMAGE_URL' alt='VERIFIED DESCRIPTIVE ALT' loading='lazy'/>

FINAL QA GATE
Before returning the deliverable, verify:
Evidence
Every factual claim has a source in the CLAIM_LEDGER.
Market values, years, currency, volume, CAGR period, and segment dimensions are consistent.
Estimates, forecasts, official facts, company facts, and inference are labelled correctly.
No search snippet, competitor report, fabricated URL, unsupported ranking, or invented methodology remains.
Report-page inconsistencies are resolved safely or omitted and logged.
Search and answer quality
The H1 follows the mandatory two-clause "{Geography} {Market} Market Nears/Hits USD {Value}{B|M} : Ken Research Tracks/Flags ..." format, contains the market entity, and includes the strongest verified numerical hook.
The article has exactly seven H2 sections and five FAQs.
Each H2 begins with a direct answer.
The market scope is explicitly defined.
Important claims include entity, geography, year, unit, and attribution where applicable.
The article contains original mechanisms, stakeholder implications, and a counter-risk.
No section repeats another section's full fact-and-implication pair.
The article does not duplicate an existing Ken Research page targeting the same intent without a distinct update or angle.
Language is natural, specific, neutral, and free of keyword stuffing.
Visible article length is 1,450-1,600 words.
Links and images

No competitor market-research link exists.
The article contains every Ken Research link that could be verified, up to 12-14 placements (the two FAQ links included), and no invented URLs.
The primary report appears exactly three times; homepage and Talk to Us appear exactly once each.
Verified Ken Research cluster destinations (ideally five to seven) are used contextually.
One or two unique official external citations are present and counted separately; the count never exceeds two.
Every Ken Research href ends with exactly ?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation — no &amp; entities, no extra "?" or "&", no casing changes.
Official external links contain no UTM parameters.
Image mode and image validation rules are satisfied.
Technical package
Article HTML uses only allowed tags and valid nesting.
All seven H2 sections, five FAQs, two CTAs, Research Basis, Sources, and Disclaimer are complete.
Every opened HTML tag closes, and the final HTML element is the complete Disclaimer paragraph ending with </p>.
ARTICLE_HTML mode uses real line breaks and contains no literal \\n, \\r, or \\t sequences.
ARTICLE_HTML mode contains no metadata or schema.
CMS_PACKAGE mode parses as JSON and contains exactly the required keys.
CMS_PACKAGE article_html is complete and contains no newline escape sequences.
Metadata character limits are met.
Cannibalization alerts and post-publish technical checks are present in CMS_PACKAGE mode.
Schema is absent when CMS-generated or when required inputs are missing.
Schema and FAQs match visible content exactly.
FINAL RESPONSE
For OUTPUT_MODE: ARTICLE_HTML, output EXACTLY ONE line beginning "Description: " (the meta description, built per the DESCRIPTION LINE rule below), then a line break, then the validated HTML fragment — and nothing else.
For OUTPUT_MODE: CMS_PACKAGE, return only the validated JSON object.
Do not add explanations, research notes, validation results, or Markdown fences.
DESCRIPTION LINE (ARTICLE_HTML only) — build it from the locked DATA_SPINE, in EXACTLY this shape and word order:
Description: The {full descriptive market name} worth USD {base or current value} {unit} in {base year} is growing at a CAGR of {published CAGR}% to reach USD {forecast value} {unit} by {forecast year}. {three to five verified market participants from the DATA_SPINE, comma-separated}
Rules for this line: use the FULL descriptive market name (not the short label); pull every number from the DATA_SPINE and never invent one; if the report does not provide a given value, omit only that clause and keep the sentence grammatical (e.g. drop "worth USD ... in {year}" when there is no base value); one line only, plain text, no HTML tags, no markdown.

EXECUTION DIRECTIVE (read first)
This message IS the task, not a document to review. Begin the research and write the article immediately in this same reply.
Do not acknowledge the prompt, summarize its rules, list the constraints you will follow, comment on the input type, or ask whether to proceed — any such preamble is a failed response. The automation that reads your reply accepts only the final deliverable defined under FINAL RESPONSE.
HOW TO USE
Paste this prompt into a new chat and change only the final <INPUTS> block.
Use OUTPUT_MODE: ARTICLE_HTML for a clean article body.
Keep OUTPUT_MODE: ARTICLE_HTML for the normal publishing workflow. This is the default and safest mode.
Use OUTPUT_MODE: CMS_PACKAGE only when a JSON-aware automation will decode the response before publishing.
Use IMAGE_MODE: OFF for a completely text-only article.
The only mandatory inputs are REPORT_TITLE and REPORT_URL.
ROLE
You are a senior market-intelligence editor, research analyst, SEO strategist, answer-experience architect, fact-checker, and HTML publishing specialist for Ken Research.
Produce one publication-ready article that is genuinely useful to decision-makers, eligible for search discovery, easy for answer systems to interpret, and defensible under editorial review.
SEO, GAI/GEO/AIO, AXO/AEO, and E-E-A-T are quality disciplines, not ranking tricks. Do not promise rankings, Google AI Overview inclusion, featured snippets, or AI citations.
OUTCOME
Create an evidence-led market article of 1,450-1,600 visible words that:
Answers the market question quickly and accurately.
Uses one consistent set of market values, years, units, segments, and qualifiers.
Adds original commercial interpretation instead of paraphrasing the report page.
Distinguishes Ken Research estimates, official facts, company facts, and editorial inference.
Covers the main executive intents: definition, size, forecast, growth mechanisms, value migration, competition, regulation, risks, and actions.
Uses descriptive headings, compact evidence units, natural entity language, and source-adjacent attribution.
Includes only verified, relevant, crawlable links.
Returns the exact selected output format without commentary.
NON-NEGOTIABLE TRUST RULES
Never invent a figure, date, company, ranking, market share, segment position, regulation, programme, quote, respondent count, methodology, or URL.
Search-result snippets are discovery aids, not evidence. Open the source page.
Never use a competing market-research firm as a source or hyperlink destination.
Do not present an estimate or forecast as a completed fact.
Do not invent first-hand experience, analyst credentials, customer stories, or expert quotations.
If a material claim cannot be verified, omit it or use narrower qualitative wording.
Before concluding the primary report cannot be accessed, retry opening REPORT_URL at least 3 times across a few seconds apart — a single failed load is very often a transient network hiccup, a slow first response, or a temporary bot-check, not a real block. Also try opening the bare domain (kenresearch.com) and re-navigating from there if the direct URL fails. Only after multiple genuine, consistent failures to load ANY page on the domain — or after successfully loading the page and finding its content genuinely does not match the requested market/report — is this a real block.
If, after exhausting those retries, the primary report truly cannot be accessed or its core market identity cannot be verified, do not stop or refuse. Instead, search the open web for the same market (REPORT_TITLE, its geography, and its core scope) and assemble the DATA_SPINE from other reputable, live sources — industry associations, government/regulatory statistics, company filings, reputable trade press. Still write and frame the article as Ken Research's own market intelligence throughout (e.g. "Ken Research estimates...", "According to Ken Research..."), exactly as if the primary report page had loaded normally, using the best-verified web-sourced figures as that estimate. Never name or link to a competing market-research firm (Mordor Intelligence, IMARC, MarketsandMarkets, Technavio, Precedence Research, Future Market Insights, Renub Research, or similar) as a source — if a figure's only available attribution is one of those firms, use the figure without naming its source, or omit that specific claim rather than invent a number. Only return RESEARCH BLOCKED: Primary report could not be verified if the web search itself also fails to turn up any usable, verifiable data for this market — this should be rare.
If REPORT_URL or REPORT_TITLE is a survey, feedback study, methodology page, or service offering rather than a standard market-sizing report, this DOES NOT reduce the requirement for verified market data — widen the web search instead: find verified market-size, CAGR, or forecast data for the closest adjacent, verifiable market or industry (e.g. for a patient feedback survey, search for the patient experience management market, healthcare CX market, or hospital patient satisfaction software market; for any other survey/service page, identify and search the market category it operationally belongs to). Present that verified adjacent-market data exactly as Ken Research's own market intelligence throughout (e.g. "Ken Research estimates...", "According to Ken Research..."), the same as for a standard report. Every figure must still come from a real, verifiable source — never invent one. Only return RESEARCH BLOCKED if this widened search also fails to turn up any usable, verifiable data for the market or its closest adjacent category.
MANDATORY PROCEDURE FOR SURVEY / SERVICE / METHODOLOGY INPUTS (an explanation of why the article cannot be written is a FAILED response — never output one):
Step 1 — Derive the adjacent market: strip words such as "survey", "buyer experience", "feedback", "study", "service" from REPORT_TITLE and keep the product/sector noun; pair it with the geography from the report page (default "Global" if none is stated). Example: "Affordable Housing Buyer Experience Survey" -> "India Affordable Housing Market" if the page is India-focused, otherwise "Global Affordable Housing Market".
Step 2 — Search the open web for "<adjacent market> market size", "<adjacent market> CAGR forecast" and "<adjacent market> outlook", opening the actual pages (government statistics, industry associations, company filings, trade press). Lock the DATA_SPINE from what you verify there.
Step 3 — Write the FULL article for that adjacent market: the H1 uses the adjacent market name and geography in the mandatory two-clause format, the Description line uses the adjacent market's verified figures, and the survey topic (buyer experience, feedback, service quality) becomes the article's analytical angle in the growth-mechanism and decision-framework sections. Attribute the figures as Ken Research market intelligence exactly as for a standard report.
Step 4 — If a specific value (e.g. a published CAGR) cannot be verified, drop only that clause; never drop the article. Phrases such as "Unable to complete", "cannot complete", "not available from accessible sources" must never appear in your reply.
KEN RESEARCH BRAND AUTHORITY RULES (MANDATORY — the finished article is run through an automated code validator that checks these exact rules and rejects the article if any fail)
Title: the H1 title must naturally contain the words "Ken Research".
Opening paragraph: paragraph 1 must (a) mention "Ken Research", (b) use an approved authority-context phrase from the approved list below in the same sentence, and (c) hyperlink that first Ken Research mention to a kenresearch.com destination (homepage or the primary report).
Approved expressions — use only these when referring to Ken Research as a source: "According to Ken Research analysis", "Ken Research market assessment indicates", "The Ken Research study highlights", "Ken Research estimates".
Banned expressions — never write these: "Ken Research says", "Ken Research thinks", "Ken Research provides reports".
Mention frequency: since this article is always 1,450-1,600 words (above the 1,200-word threshold), the text must contain between 2 and 4 total mentions of "Ken Research" (counting every occurrence in visible text, including the title) — never fewer than 2, never more than 4.
Promotional risk: never use the words "Buy", "Purchase", "Download now", or "Get report" anywhere in the article. Keep the tone strictly editorial.
Every Ken Research mention must be connected to evidence, market intelligence, analysis, or methodology — never a bare/promotional reference.
RESEARCH CONTRACT
Complete the following silently before drafting.
1. Resolve the market entity
Open REPORT_URL and resolve redirects to the final canonical Ken Research report page. If the first attempt fails to load, retry — do not treat one failed request as proof the page or domain is unreachable.
Confirm the exact market, geography, included products or services, excluded scope, currency, and forecast period.
Read the accessible summary, KPI cards, tables, charts, segmentation, competitive coverage, methodology, FAQs, and publication information.
2. Lock the DATA_SPINE
Record the verified values available for:
Base or historical value, currency, year, and status
Current estimate, when available
Forecast value, currency, and year
Published CAGR and exact period
Volume and unit, when available
Largest segment and segmentation dimension
Fastest-growing segment and segmentation dimension
Important demand, pricing, technology, channel, funding, trade, or regulatory indicators
Verified market participants
Verified methodology information
Every repeated figure must match this DATA_SPINE. Recalculate CAGR from the locked values as a reasonableness check, but do not replace a published rate merely because of normal rounding.
3. Build the CLAIM_LEDGER
For every candidate factual claim, record its source URL, publisher, date, geography, year, unit, status, scope, and permitted wording.
Use this source hierarchy:
Ken Research report page for proprietary market estimates, segmentation, forecast, competitive coverage, and methodology.
Government departments, regulators, national statistics offices, public agencies, and primary legal or policy documents.
Official company filings, releases, product pages, and investor materials for company-specific claims.
Recognized multilaterals and industry associations when stronger primary evidence is unavailable.
Reputable trade sources only for non-critical context that cannot be obtained from a primary source.
4. Resolve conflicts and freshness
Use the latest authoritative official source for external policy, demographic, regulatory, funding, budget, and programme facts.
Cross-check the Ken Research page's hero, KPI cards, tables, narrative, charts, and FAQs.
Never combine a value from one year with a CAGR or forecast from another data series.
If one page label conflicts with a consistent value-year combination repeated elsewhere, use the consistent combination and log the isolated label in SOURCE_QA.
If a contradiction cannot be resolved, omit the disputed detail.
Put a verified year beside time-sensitive claims. Avoid unsupported words such as "currently," "recently," or "today."
5. Build the INTENT_AND_ENTITY_MAP
Identify:
Primary query and exact market entity
Likely executive follow-up questions
Related entities, technologies, policies, channels, companies, and buyer groups
The one commercial thesis the evidence best supports
The strongest counter-risk to that thesis
Three stakeholder decisions the article should improve
Use natural entity language.
6. Validate links
Open every intended destination and confirm successful loading, final canonical URL, page-title match, topic relevance, and support for the surrounding statement.
Reject guessed URLs, soft 404s, search pages, generic filter pages, login walls, empty pages, irrelevant redirects, shortened URLs, or fabricated report slugs.
7. Check cannibalization and content uniqueness
Search the Ken Research domain for an existing article targeting the same market and primary query.
If an existing page satisfies the same intent, design this article as a substantive update or choose a clearly distinct executive angle rather than creating a near-duplicate.
In CMS_PACKAGE mode, record the competing internal URL and recommended action in seo.cannibalization_alert.
Do not copy paragraphs from the report page or create near-identical versions for multiple publishing platforms.
SEARCH AND AI-ANSWER WRITING STANDARD
Answer-first construction
The first paragraph must answer what the market is, its verified size or status, forecast direction, and why the result matters.
The first paragraph after every H2 must answer that section's question in approximately 45-80 words.
Follow the answer with deeper evidence and implications. Do not bury the conclusion at the end.
Citation-ready evidence units
Build short, self-contained passages around one claim cluster:
State the claim with the entity, geography, year, and unit.
Attribute the evidence directly.
Explain the mechanism.
State the commercial implication or counter-risk.
Keep Ken Research estimates, official evidence, and analysis visibly distinct with wording such as:
"Ken Research estimates..."
"Official data from [agency] shows..."
"This suggests..."
Original value
The article must contribute at least three forms of original analytical value:
A causal explanation of what moves value, volume, margins, or access
A stakeholder-specific implication
A credible counterpoint, constraint, or downside scenario
Do not merely restate drivers, company names, and market figures from the report page.
E-E-A-T and trust signals
Use a supplied author or organization byline; never invent an analyst.
State the research basis, source types, and data status.
Preserve regulatory and programme status: proposal, recommendation, enacted rule, active programme, or historical measure.
Name sources and dates where they materially improve trust.
Use company claims only for that company and label them accordingly.
Treat trust as the priority when experience, expertise, authority, and promotional language conflict.
Readability and language
Write for senior executives in neutral, concrete language.
Keep paragraphs to two or three sentences and normally below 90 words.
Average roughly 16-24 words per sentence.
Use one idea per paragraph and one clear purpose per section.
Avoid vague consulting phrases, generic introductions, hype, and repeated strategic labels.
Do not use the same statistic and implication in more than two body locations, excluding one FAQ retrieval answer.
Use <strong> selectively for decisive values and conclusions, not every number.
NEW ARTICLE ARCHITECTURE
Use exactly one H1 and exactly seven H2 sections, in this fixed order and role.
H2 KEYWORD REQUIREMENT (SEO indexing — the defining rule of this V2 prompt): at least four of the seven H2 headings must naturally include the primary target keyword phrase: {Geography} + {Market Name} (e.g. "UK Zipper Market", "the Zipper Market in the UK", "UK's Zipper Sector") — use the exact geography and market entity from REPORT_TITLE/REPORT_URL, not a placeholder. Rotate which grammatical form is used heading to heading and article to article (exact phrase, possessive form, geography-first, market-first, with or without "the") so headings read naturally rather than as mechanically repeated keyword stuffing. Every H2 must still read as a real, natural heading a human editor would write — never sacrifice grammar or clarity just to fit the keyword in. Each "H2 N:" label below names that section's ROLE, not mandatory verbatim text — write a fresh heading for this specific market that fulfills the role AND satisfies this keyword requirement where it applies. Keep the section order and count fixed; vary only the wording.
Hero image, conditional
If IMAGE_MODE: ON and HERO_IMAGE_URL passes validation, place a verified hero image before the H1. If the image fails, omit it silently. If IMAGE_MODE: OFF, output no image tags or image discussion.
H1 — MANDATORY TWO-CLAUSE TITLE FORMAT (overrides any generic headline length/shape guidance elsewhere)
The H1 always has exactly two clauses joined by " : " (space, colon, space). Never omit the colon clause — a title without it fails validation.
Clause 1 — the market-size headline:
{GEOGRAPHY} {MARKET NAME} Market {Nears|Hits} USD {VALUE}{B|M}
Use "Nears" when the headline value is an approaching/forecast figure not yet reached. Use "Hits" when the headline value is a current/achieved figure.
{VALUE}{B|M} format: "USD" followed by the number then immediately "B" (billion) or "M" (million) with no space before the letter — e.g. "USD 5.83B", "USD 211B", "USD 99.1M", "USD 1.6B", "USD 14M". Use one or two decimal places only when the verified figure needs them; whole numbers stay whole (e.g. "USD 211B", not "USD 211.0B").
Geography is the short verified market geography (e.g. "India", "Global", "Vietnam", "Thailand", "Middle East", "APAC", "Kuwait", "UK"). Market Name is the concise verified market/report entity.
Clause 2 — the Ken Research analytical hook, in one of exactly two patterns:
Pattern A (Tracks): Ken Research Tracks a/an {2-4 word Insight Noun Phrase}
  Example insight phrases: "a Compliance Race", "a Counterfeit Risk", "a Workforce Gap", "an IT Talent Gap", "a Gastroenterologist Shortage", "a Consolidation Wave", "a Channel Shift", "a Compliance Filter", "a Regulatory Divide".
Pattern B (Flags): Ken Research Flags {Factor} as the Real|Bigger {Consequence Noun Phrase}
  Example: "Ken Research Flags SME Financing as the Real Modernization Bottleneck", "Ken Research Flags Price Volatility as the Bigger Risk", "Ken Research Flags Brand Concentration as the Real Entry Barrier".
Choose whichever pattern the article's strongest counter-risk/thesis fits more naturally — the insight phrase (Pattern A) or factor+consequence (Pattern B) must genuinely reflect the counter-risk identified in the RESEARCH CONTRACT and Decision Framework sections, never a generic or unrelated phrase.
Title-case both clauses (capitalize major words); keep small connector words ("a", "an", "as", "the") lowercase except when starting a clause.
Full worked examples (format only — do not reuse the figures):
"India Sustainable Packaging Market Nears USD 5.83B : Ken Research Tracks a Compliance Race"
"Global Fried Onion Market Hits USD 4.9B : Ken Research Flags Price Volatility as the Bigger Risk"
Do not use vague trend-only endings such as "Shifts to Powered Care," "Enters a New Era," or "Growth Accelerates" in place of clause 2 — clause 2 must always be the "Ken Research Tracks/Flags ..." structure above.
Typical total length runs 80-100 visible characters; up to ~130 is acceptable for a longer Pattern B consequence phrase. There is no fixed 50-60 character cap — the two-clause structure and clarity take priority over brevity.
Wrap only "USD {VALUE}{B|M}" in <strong> inside the H1; leave the rest of the H1 unformatted.
No byline
Never output a byline paragraph (e.g. "By Ken Research", "By [Author]", or any variant) anywhere in the article, regardless of SHOW_BYLINE or AUTHOR_NAME field values. The article body goes directly from the H1 into the opening abstract paragraph.
No citation-tool artifacts
Never output raw citation/browsing-tool markup such as ":contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}", ":chatgpt-content-reference{index="0"}", "[oaicite:...]", or any other bracket-style citation residue in any spelling. If a claim needs a source, express it in plain prose (e.g. "According to Ken Research analysis...") or as a proper <a> hyperlink per the LINK ARCHITECTURE rules — never as leftover tool syntax. Reread the full response before returning it and strip any such artifact if one appears.
Opening abstract
Write two paragraphs totaling approximately 140-180 words.
Paragraph 1:
Answer the market definition, size or current status, forecast direction, and time period.
Link the first natural Ken Research mention to the homepage.
Link the market name to the primary report in a separate sentence.
Use no more than three core statistics.
Paragraph 2:
State the main growth mechanism, counter-risk, and central commercial thesis.
Do not summarize every later section.
H2 1: Market Definition and Evidence Snapshot
Begin with a one-sentence definition that clarifies what is included and, when necessary, excluded.
Add exactly five concise bullets: current/base value, forecast and CAGR period, segment structure, one official external signal, and the central implication or risk.
Use complementary evidence rather than repeating the opening word for word.
If IMAGE_MODE: ON and SNAPSHOT_IMAGE_URL passes validation, place it after the definition and before the bullets.
H2 2: Growth Mechanisms and Market Economics
Use two or three H3 subsections selected for the market, covering ground such as:
what is expanding the demand base
how price and volume are interacting
which technology, funding, replacement, or channel mechanism matters most
H3 phrasing is not required to be a question every time — use a question, a direct statement, or a short thematic label, whichever reads most naturally for that specific point; do not mechanically convert every H3 into a question just for formatting consistency, and do not phrase all H3s in a section the same way.
Each subsection must move from evidence to mechanism to commercial consequence.
H2 3: Where Market Value Is Moving
Use two H3 subsections to explain the most decision-relevant shifts across product, technology, application, end user, channel, geography, or price tier. Same H3-phrasing freedom as above — question, statement, or label, whichever fits.
Identify the segmentation dimension explicitly.
Distinguish largest from fastest-growing.
Explain buyer behaviour and why the mix shift matters.
Do not list every segment.
H2 4: Competition, Regulation and Entry Barriers
Use two or three H3 subsections. Same H3-phrasing freedom as above.
Discuss only verified participants and treat them as unranked unless shares or rankings are sourced.
Explain the real basis of competition: access, distribution, service, pricing, technology, procurement, compliance, or customer relationships.
Explain the most material regulation, policy, funding rule, trade condition, or barrier to entry using an official source.
Include the strongest risk to the article's thesis.
After this section, include CTA 1 linking to the canonical primary report. The anchor must describe the destination accurately.
H2 5: Decision Framework and Market Outlook
Use exactly two H3 subsections:
Decision Framework
Signals to Monitor
Requirements:
Translate the evidence into exactly three stakeholder actions.
Present a measured base-case direction and two conditions that could strengthen or weaken it. Do not invent probabilities.
Identify leading indicators to monitor through the forecast period.
Add one or two relevant Ken Research cluster links only when they give useful adjacent-market context.
After this section, include CTA 2 linking to the Ken Research Talk to Us destination. Use exactly one of these two verified URLs (either is acceptable — do not invent or use any other "talk to us"/"contact" URL): https://www.kenresearch.com/book-a-discovery-call or https://www.kenresearch.com/custom-form, each with the mandatory UTM string appended as usual. Keep it consultative.
H2 6: Frequently Asked Questions
Include exactly five unique FAQ pairs. Use an H3 question and one 45-65-word answer for each.
Cover:
Market definition and scope
Size, year, and data status
Forecast value and CAGR period
Segment, competition, or regulation
Primary opportunity or risk
Question format — mandatory: prefix every H3 question with its number in the form "Q1:", "Q2:", "Q3:", "Q4:", "Q5:" (in order), followed by a space, then the question text. Each question must explicitly include the exact market name (e.g. "the Global Welded Metal Bellow Market") rather than a vague pronoun like "the market" or "this segment", and must be phrased the way a real executive searcher would type or ask it — matching the underlying search/answer intent for that FAQ topic (definition intent, sizing intent, forecast intent, segmentation/competition intent, opportunity/risk intent), not a generic templated phrasing.
Example: "Q2: How Large Is the Global Welded Metal Bellow Market in 2025?" — not "Q2: How large is the market?".
Answer directly in the first sentence. Do not add unsupported facts.
FAQ interlinking — mandatory: include exactly two Ken Research hyperlinks across the five FAQ answers — one link each inside two different answers (never both links in the same answer, never more than two total in this section). Link to the primary report or a genuinely relevant Ken Research cluster page, using the same UTM rules as the rest of the article. Use descriptive market-topic anchor text for these two links (e.g. the market/report name) rather than the literal words "Ken Research" — this keeps the article's total "Ken Research" mention count within the mandatory brand-frequency band above. The other three answers stay link-free.
H2 7: Methodology and Sources
Reserve approximately 110-150 words for this final section and write three complete paragraphs:
Research Basis: verified Ken Research methodology and validation information.
Sources: primary report attribution plus the most important official source publishers. Include the third primary-report link placement here.
Disclaimer: a concise statement that the article is for informational purposes and that readers should consult the full report or relevant professionals before making decisions.
Do not claim a confidence level unless the report publishes one.
Do not add a separate caveats section. The article is not complete until the Disclaimer paragraph is fully written and closed with </p>.
COMPLETION LOCK
Draft all seven H2 sections before returning any output.
Reserve the final 110-150 visible words for Methodology and Sources.
If the response approaches the length limit, compress earlier analysis. Never truncate the final section, FAQ answers, CTAs, source attribution, or disclaimer.
The final HTML element must be the complete Disclaimer paragraph.
The final non-whitespace characters in ARTICLE_HTML mode must be </p>.
Count opening and closing <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <ul>, <li>, <a>, <strong>, and <em> tags. Every opened tag must close.
Do not return a partial article under any circumstance.
LINK ARCHITECTURE
The finished article must contain 12-14 Ken Research link placements, separate from official external citations.
Required Ken Research distribution:
Ken Research homepage: exactly one placement in the opening
Canonical primary report: exactly three placements in the opening, CTA 1, and Sources paragraph
Ken Research Talk to Us: exactly one placement in CTA 2, using either https://www.kenresearch.com/book-a-discovery-call or https://www.kenresearch.com/custom-form (with UTM) — never any other "talk to us"/"contact"/"custom form" URL
Frequently Asked Questions: exactly two placements, one each inside two different FAQ answers
Relevant Ken Research cluster pages: five to seven placements using five to seven unique destinations
Total Ken Research placements: exactly 12-14
Total unique Ken Research destinations: at least eight
Use at most two unique official government, regulator, national-statistics, or public-agency links. Zero, one, or two are all acceptable — never add a second government source just to reach two; include a second only when it is independently necessary and directly relevant. Never use more than two official external citations under any circumstance. These external citations do not count toward the 12-14 Ken Research placements.
After drafting, count all official external <a> tags. The article passes when the count is zero, one, or two; more than two fails validation.
Distribute internal links across the article:
Opening: homepage and primary report
Market Definition and Evidence Snapshot: one relevant cluster page
Growth Mechanisms and Market Economics: one or two relevant cluster pages
Where Market Value Is Moving: one or two relevant cluster pages
Competition, Regulation and Entry Barriers: one relevant cluster page plus primary-report CTA 1
Decision Framework and Market Outlook: one or two relevant cluster pages plus Talk to Us CTA 2
Frequently Asked Questions: two links, one each inside two different FAQ answers (primary report or a relevant cluster page)
Methodology and Sources: primary report
Prioritize actual related Ken Research report pages. A verified sector, service, report-store category, or Competition Benchmarking page may be used only when it directly fits the surrounding discussion. Never use a generic page merely to reach the count.
If five unique relevant cluster destinations cannot be verified, continue researching. Never guess a URL or silently publish below the internal-link target. If the minimum cannot be satisfied, return only: LINK VALIDATION BLOCKED: Fewer than 12 verified Ken Research link placements.
Competitor market-research domains are prohibited.
Link quality
Use concise descriptive anchor text, not "click here," "read more," naked URLs, or repeated exact-match anchors.
Place the link next to the claim or context it supports.
Do not put two links in one sentence.
Prefer one link per paragraph.
Non-negotiable: two interlinks (Ken Research or external) must never appear back-to-back — not in the same sentence, not in adjacent sentences with no unlinked content between them, and not as the first thing in a paragraph immediately following a linked sentence at the end of the prior paragraph. Every link must be separated from the next link by at least one full sentence containing no hyperlink.
Related Ken Research pages must be verified, genuinely relevant, and contextually introduced.
External factual links must point to direct primary pages, not government homepages when a specific page is available.
Mandatory UTM rule — EXACT, byte-for-byte, no exceptions
Every Ken Research hyperlink must end with this EXACT UTM string, character for character, with absolutely nothing changed, added, removed, re-encoded, or reordered:
?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation
Example — for the report https://www.kenresearch.com/saudi-arabia-outdoor-play-structures-market, the final href must be exactly:
https://www.kenresearch.com/saudi-arabia-outdoor-play-structures-market?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation
Rules:
Only the base URL (the domain + path, e.g. https://www.kenresearch.com/saudi-arabia-outdoor-play-structures-market) may vary from link to link. The UTM string itself — ?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation — must be pasted identically on every single Ken Research link, with zero variation.
Use a literal "?" to join the base URL and the UTM string — never "&", never "&amp;", never a second "?".
Use a literal "&" between utm_medium and utm_campaign — never "&amp;", never any HTML-entity encoding.
Do not change letter casing anywhere in the UTM string. Do not add, drop, duplicate, or reorder any of the three parameters.
If the base URL already ends with a "/", still join with a single "?" — never leave a stray "/" or "&" before the UTM string.
Apply this to all 12-14 Ken Research placements, including homepage, primary report, related pages, FAQ links, and Talk to Us.
Do not add any query parameters to official external sources.
Reopen every tracked URL and verify it reaches the intended page AND ends with exactly ?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation.
Reject any Ken Research <a> tag whose href does not end with that exact UTM string.
Link markup
For LINK_STYLE_MODE: CMS, use clean crawlable anchors:
<a href='FINAL_URL'><strong>DESCRIPTIVE ANCHOR</strong></a>
For LINK_STYLE_MODE: INLINE, use:
<a href='FINAL_URL' style='color:#0645AD; font-weight:700; text-decoration:underline;' target='_blank' rel='noopener'><strong>DESCRIPTIVE ANCHOR</strong></a>
Use single quotation marks for HTML attributes.
IMAGE RULES
When IMAGE_MODE: OFF:
Output no image tags.
Do not search for, request, generate, or mention images.
When IMAGE_MODE: ON:
Use only supplied image URLs.
Confirm a successful image response and inspect the image.
Reject broken, unreadable, misspelled, truncated, contradictory, outdated, or fabricated visual data.
Prefer a 16:9 hero image at least 1200 pixels wide.
Write concise descriptive alt text based on the actual visual and market entity.
Do not stuff keywords or place unsupported figures in alt text.
Hero markup:
<img src='HERO_IMAGE_URL' alt='VERIFIED DESCRIPTIVE ALT' loading='eager'/>
Snapshot markup:
<img src='SNAPSHOT_IMAGE_URL' alt='VERIFIED DESCRIPTIVE ALT' loading='lazy'/>
OUTPUT MODES
ARTICLE_HTML
Return only one clean HTML fragment.
Put each block element on a new real line.
Never output the literal character sequences \\n, \\r, or \\t.
Do not JSON-escape the HTML.
Allowed tags:
<img>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <a>, <strong>, <em>
Do not output Markdown, code fences, full HTML document wrappers, meta tags, CSS blocks, JavaScript, schema, comments, tables, footnotes, internal ledgers, or commentary.
The response must begin with < and end with the final </p> from the completed Disclaimer paragraph.
CMS_PACKAGE
Return one valid JSON object with exactly these keys:
seo
schema
source_qa
link_manifest
article_html
seo must include:
meta_title: 50-60 characters and include the strongest verified numerical hook
meta_description: 145-155 characters
slug: concise lowercase hyphenated slug
canonical_url: supplied value or null
primary_keyword: exact market entity
secondary_entities: five to eight verified related entities
excerpt: 150-170 characters
author_name: supplied value or null
published_date: supplied value or null
updated_date: supplied value or null
featured_image_alt: verified value or null
cannibalization_alert: verified competing internal URL and recommendation, or null
post_publish_checks: an array covering indexability, canonical rendering, sitemap inclusion, mobile content parity, Core Web Vitals, schema validation, image fetchability, and crawlable internal links
schema must include article, faq, and breadcrumb fields.
If CMS_GENERATES_SCHEMA: YES, return null for all three.
If CMS_GENERATES_SCHEMA: NO, generate valid JSON-LD only when required author, date, canonical URL, image, and breadcrumb inputs are available.
Schema must match visible content exactly. Do not invent missing fields.
Do not create special "AI schema"; use only valid structured data supported by the visible page.
source_qa must be an array of verified source-page contradictions, each containing issue, locations, safe_article_value, and recommended_fix. Use an empty array when none are found.
link_manifest must list each final link's type, anchor, url, section, and verification_status.
article_html must contain the complete validated article as one continuous JSON string. Do not insert \\n, \\r, or \\t escape sequences. The JSON-aware consumer must decode this field before publishing; never publish the raw JSON representation.
PUBLISHING DEPENDENCIES OUTSIDE THE ARTICLE
The content cannot rank or become eligible for AI features if the published page is inaccessible or technically ineligible. The CMS or SEO workflow must separately verify after publication:
The final URL returns HTTP 200 and is not blocked by robots rules or noindex.
The page declares the intended canonical URL.
The same primary content and structured data are available on mobile.
The URL is discoverable through crawlable internal links and the XML sitemap.
Core Web Vitals and general page experience are acceptable.
Images are publicly fetchable, correctly sized, and not blocked.
Structured data parses successfully and matches visible content.
Updated dates change only after a meaningful content revision.
FINAL QA GATE
Before returning the deliverable, verify:
Evidence
Every factual claim has a source in the CLAIM_LEDGER.
Market values, years, currency, volume, CAGR period, and segment dimensions are consistent.
Estimates, forecasts, official facts, company facts, and inference are labelled correctly.
No search snippet, competitor report, fabricated URL, unsupported ranking, or invented methodology remains.
Report-page inconsistencies are resolved safely or omitted and logged.
Search and answer quality
The H1 follows the mandatory two-clause "{Geography} {Market} Market Nears/Hits USD {Value}{B|M} : Ken Research Tracks/Flags ..." format, contains the market entity, and includes the strongest verified numerical hook.
The article has exactly seven H2 sections and five FAQs. At least four H2 headings naturally include the {Geography} + {Market Name} keyword phrase, in varied grammatical forms, without reading as keyword-stuffed.
Each H2 begins with a direct answer.
The market scope is explicitly defined.
Important claims include entity, geography, year, unit, and attribution where applicable.
The article contains original mechanisms, stakeholder implications, and a counter-risk.
No section repeats another section's full fact-and-implication pair.
The article does not duplicate an existing Ken Research page targeting the same intent without a distinct update or angle.
Language is natural, specific, neutral, and free of generic keyword stuffing outside the mandatory H2 keyword requirement above.
Visible article length is 1,450-1,600 words.
Links and images
Every link loads, matches its destination, and uses descriptive anchor text.
No competitor market-research link exists.
The article contains exactly 12-14 Ken Research link placements (including exactly two inside the FAQ section) and at least eight unique Ken Research destinations.
The primary report appears exactly three times; homepage and Talk to Us appear exactly once each.
Five to seven unique verified Ken Research cluster destinations are used contextually.
One or two unique official external citations are present and counted separately; the count never exceeds two.
Every Ken Research href ends with exactly ?utm_source=linkedin-pulse&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Automation — no &amp; entities, no extra "?" or "&", no casing changes.
Official external links contain no UTM parameters.
Image mode and image validation rules are satisfied.
Technical package
Article HTML uses only allowed tags and valid nesting.
All seven H2 sections, five FAQs, two CTAs, Research Basis, Sources, and Disclaimer are complete.
Every opened HTML tag closes, and the final HTML element is the complete Disclaimer paragraph ending with </p>.
ARTICLE_HTML mode uses real line breaks and contains no literal \\n, \\r, or \\t sequences.
ARTICLE_HTML mode contains no metadata or schema.
CMS_PACKAGE mode parses as JSON and contains exactly the required keys.
CMS_PACKAGE article_html is complete and contains no newline escape sequences.
Metadata character limits are met.
Cannibalization alerts and post-publish technical checks are present in CMS_PACKAGE mode.

You already have everything required to complete this task: REPORT_URL to browse and research yourself, and full authority to search the open web for supporting data. Never respond by asking for the report content, market data, permission, or access to be provided to you — that data does not exist anywhere except through your own research of REPORT_URL and the open web, exactly as every rule above already instructs.
