 * blogGenLoop.ts — autorun: picks "New Logic" rows that have a Target URL
 * but no Blog Content yet, generates the article and cover image
 * CONCURRENTLY in two separate Chrome windows (blogGenAgent.ts /
 * blogImageAgent.ts each launch their own persistent context — see those
 * files), writes the result back, then re-reads that same cell from the
 * sheet to verify it actually landed with real content (and the image URL,

 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into scheduler-new.ts's node-cron jobs: each row
 * takes ~12-15 min (blog) / up to ~9 min (image) of real ChatGPT generation
 * time through visible, logged-in Chrome windows — running that inside the
